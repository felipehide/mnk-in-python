# MNK Landspace Problems written in Python

## Description
Tries to follow the structure of the C++ code as much as possible
This means that it may not be the most efficient code possible in Python

## TODOs: 
- The current random distribution follows a truncated gaussian distribution,
but it's not as clean as the one done in C++
Therefore, this can be improved. Note that it may affect the speed of the enumeration process.
